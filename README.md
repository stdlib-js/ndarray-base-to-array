    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

## Installation

```bash
npm install @stdlib/ndarray-base-to-array
```

Alternatively,

-   To load the package in a website via a `script` tag without installation and bundlers, use the [ES Module][es-module] available on the [`esm`][esm-url] branch (see [README][esm-readme]).
-   If you are using Deno, visit the [`deno`][deno-url] branch (see [README][deno-readme] for usage intructions).
-   For use in Observable, or in browser/node environments, use the [Universal Module Definition (UMD)][umd] build available on the [`umd`][umd-url] branch (see [README][umd-readme]).

The [branches.md][branches-url] file summarizes the available branches and displays a diagram illustrating their relationships.

To view installation and usage instructions specific to each branch build, be sure to explicitly navigate to the respective README files on each branch, as linked to above.

## Usage

```javascript
var ndarray2array = require( '@stdlib/ndarray-base-to-array' );
```

#### ndarray2array( buffer, shape, strides, offset, order )

Converts an ndarray buffer to a generic array (which may include nested arrays).

```javascript
var buffer = [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ];
var shape = [ 2, 2 ];
var order = 'row-major';
var strides = [ 2, 1 ];
var offset = 0;

var arr = ndarray2array( buffer, shape, strides, offset, order );
// returns [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4 ] ]
```

The `order` parameter specifies whether an array is `row-major` (C-style) or `column-major` (Fortran-style).

```javascript
var buffer = [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ];
var shape = [ 2, 2 ];
var order = 'column-major';
var strides = [ 1, 2 ];
var offset = 0;

var arr = ndarray2array( buffer, shape, strides, offset, order );
// returns [ [ 1, 3 ], [ 2, 4 ] ]
```

The `offset` parameter specifies the location of the first indexed element based on the `strides` array.

```javascript
var buffer = [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ];
var shape = [ 2, 2 ];
var order = 'row-major';
var strides = [ -2, -1 ];
var offset = 3;

var arr = ndarray2array( buffer, shape, strides, offset, order );
// returns [ [ 4, 3 ], [ 2, 1 ] ]
```

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var shape2strides = require( '@stdlib/ndarray-base-shape2strides' );
var strides2offset = require( '@stdlib/ndarray-base-strides2offset' );
var discreteUniform = require( '@stdlib/random-base-discrete-uniform' );
var ndarray2array = require( '@stdlib/ndarray-base-to-array' );

// Create a data buffer:
var buffer = [];
var i;
for ( i = 0; i < 27; i++ ) {
    buffer.push( i );
}

// Specify array meta data:
var shape = [ 3, 3, 3 ];
var order = 'column-major';
var ndims = shape.length;

// Compute array meta data:
var strides = shape2strides( shape, order );
var offset = strides2offset( shape, strides );

// Print array information:
console.log( '' );
console.log( 'Dims: %s', shape.join( 'x' ) );

// Randomly flip strides and convert an ndarray to a nested array...
var arr;
var j;
for ( i = 0; i < 20; i++ ) {
    j = discreteUniform( 0, ndims-1 );
    strides[ j ] *= -1;
    offset = strides2offset( shape, strides );

    console.log( '' );
    console.log( 'Strides: %s', strides.join( ',' ) );
    console.log( 'Offset: %d', offset );

    arr = ndarray2array( buffer, shape, strides, offset, order );
    console.log( JSON.stringify( arr ) );
}
